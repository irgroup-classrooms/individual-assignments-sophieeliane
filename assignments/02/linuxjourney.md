#Frage 4

Exercises
Run ls with different flags and see the output you receive.

ls -R: recursively list directory contents --> opens every file 
ls -r: reverse order while sorting --> $ ls -r
 selia/    desktop.ini  'Default User'@  'All Users'@
 ladmin/   Public/       Default/

ls -t: sort by modification time, newest first --> $ ls -t
 ladmin/   Default/  'Default User'@   desktop.ini
 selia/    Public/   'All Users'@


Flags like -R, -r, and -t customize how ls shows the contents of a directory, making it easier to find what you need based on structure, order, or time. You can use one flag at a time or combine them for specific effects.
